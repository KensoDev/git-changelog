# Creates Auto Changelog with every commit to master

Every commit to master will trigger an auto creation of a changelog file.

Every commit will create a tag with the time of the commit to master.

The changelog will consist of the commit messages, the person who commited it and also some files that have changed.

This is very much a WIP but I like to develop software out in the open rather than just hacking on my machine and committing when I feel it's perfect.
